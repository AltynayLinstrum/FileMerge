<h3>PDF File Merger</h3>
<p>I created this mini script with the help of Youtube tutorials, ChapGPT, online resources, and valuable insights of more experienced friends! It combines multiple PDF files into a single PDF document. The script reads all PDF files present in the current directory and merges them into a new PDF file named "combinedDoc.pdf".</p>
<h3>Technologies/Libraries Used:</h3>
<p>The script uses PyPDF2 library which is a pure-python PDF library capable of splitting, merging together, cropping, and transforming the pages of PDF files.</p>
<h3>Potential Improvements</h3>
<p>There are several improvements that could be made in the future iterations of this script:</p>
<ul>
<li>Option to choose the destination directory for the combined PDF file.</li>
<li>Ability to sort the PDF files based on their names or modified date.</li>
<li>Option to specify the order in which the PDF files should be merged.</li>
<li>Support for password-protected PDF files.</li>
<li>Option to merge specific pages of the PDF files instead of merging the entire document.</li>
</ul>
